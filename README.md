## About Me
Marco Calderon https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-calderon-b914bb16b/ My career objective is to work as a graphic designer. I aim to create original graphics for businesses or companies that need rebranding or are just starting up. Working as a UX designer is something I would also be interested in.
